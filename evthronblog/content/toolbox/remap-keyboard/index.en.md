Ergonomics is never a concern of the keyboard design.
- It wasted the most powerful fingers, the thumbs, on pressing the big fat spacebar.
- It abused the right little finger on pressing both enter and the distant backspace.
- It wasted a spot by placing the useless CapsLock at a easy-to-reach location.
- Not everyone complains about this: Esc is a common key in the text editor Vim but it is hard to reach.

I can imporve the layout by changing:
- Capslock -> Backspace
- Left Alt -> Esc
- Right Alt -> Enter

There are obsolete keys on the keyboard too.

My AutoHotKey configurations： 

## Fn Keys
- F1: Pomodoro
- F3: Saladict
- F4 Win + D Back to Desktop

F5-F8 are taskbar softwares

- F5: File Explorer
- F6: Firefox
- F7: Excel
- F8: Text editor 

2024/03/30: Now I use Dexpot, no need to switch software using Fn keys
- F5: Ctrl + F (Search)
- F6: Shift + Ctrl + T （Re-open closed tabs in browser）

## Input
- Capslock: Backspace
- Backspace: Win + Space (Switch between Chinese and Engish input methods)

2024/05/25 - Make enter and backspace closer within reach to save my little finger.
- Capslock: Backspace
- Enter: Win + Space
- Right Alt: Enter
- Backspace: Capslock

## Browsing
- Delete: Ctrl + w (Close tabs)
- Insert: Ctrl + t (Insert new tab)
- Page Up: Ctrl + Shift + Tab (Switch tab: up)
- Page Down: Ctrl + Tab (Switch tab: down)

## Vim
- Escape: Left Alt
