# PC
## Block browsing
### Leechblock NG
A must-have blocker. If you hesitate to block the whole website, study its URL carefully, you may just need a small part of the site. It's best to fully block the sites instead of setting timers.

## Block recommendation

### Unhook
Empty your homepage and recommended videos. You should only search by keywords on Youtube.

### BlockTube
Let the channels you don't like out of your sight.

### yt-dlp
Download the video before you watch. Don't watch hours and hours of stream recordings.

### uBlock Origin
It's not just an ad blocker. You can block all distracting items on any websites using its element picker.

## Block search 
### uBlacklist
Don't remind yourself that you blocked sites. Remove them from the search results.

## Read in one place 
### Any RSS reader 
Only read posts on one single page. It can replace the Youtube subscribe page.

# Phones 
## Android
### HelpMeFocus
Decent App blocker.

### Universal Android Debloater
Uninstall Google Chrome and Play Store.

## iOS
### Screen Time
Let others keep the passcode for you.
