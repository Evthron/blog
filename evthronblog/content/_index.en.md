Hello there! I hope you can know more about me through reading this blog, so I don't need to have a social media account. I go all out and write down every thought I've got here. 

- [üìù Posts](/en/posts) stores my writings.
    - [The limitations of instant messaging](/en/posts/instant-messaging) talks about my thoughts towards the flaws of online messaging.

- [üñºÔ∏è Gallery](/en/gallery) showcases my drawings.
    - [Accurate colour wheel](/en/gallery/accurate-colour-wheel) explains some facts about colour.

- [üê¶ Tweet](/en/tweet) is tweet.

- [üõ†Ô∏è Toolbox](/en/toolbox) recommends some software I use.
    - [Say goodbye to internet](/en/toolbox/say-goodbye-to-internet) lists all the tools I use to help me not waste time on internet.

- [üéÆ Skill](/en/skill) records my experience on different skill using progress bars, like a game.
    - [Gamification](/en/skill/introduction) explains why I'm trying to record my progress like a game stats.

Originally, I write in Chinese but I hope anyone can read it without a translator so I often rewrite my posts in English. Feel free to compare the slight differences between the Chinese and English (and one more?) versions.

Even though this not a Youtube channel, using the mystic ancient internet technology "RSS", you can still subscribe to this blog. Just copy the link of the "Wi-Fi logo" under my icon and paste it to your RSS reader, like [Feeder](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.nononsenseapps.feeder/) on phone or Feedbro [(Firefox)](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/feedbroreader/) [(Chrome)](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/feedbro/mefgmmbdailogpfhfblcnnjfmnpnmdfa) on browser.

If you don't subscribe, I'll grab your phone and do it for you. Just kidding. I'll be grateful if you could tell me how you feel about this site.
