Hello there! Reading a person's work is a good way to get a gist of his personality and hobbies. Maybe I can use this for ice breaking?

I mainly posts my writings and artworks.

This blog is originally written in Chinese. I hope anyone can read it naturally without a translator so I rewrite the posts in multiple languages. It's for my own practice too. Feel free to compare the slight differences between languages if you know them.
