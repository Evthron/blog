Hello there! I hope you can know more about me through reading this blog. 

I mainly posts my writings and drawings.

Originally, I write in Chinese but I hope anyone can read it without a translator so I often rewrite my posts in English. Feel free to compare the slight differences between the Chinese and English (and one more?) versions.

Even though this not a Youtube channel, using the mystic ancient internet technology "RSS", you can still subscribe to this blog. Just copy the link of the "Wi-Fi logo" under my icon and paste it to your RSS reader, like Feeder on phone and Feedbro on browser.
