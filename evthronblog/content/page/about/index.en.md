Hello there! Reading a person's work is a good way to get a gist of his personality and hobbies. Maybe I can use this for ice breaking?

I mainly posts my writings and gallerys.

This blog is originally written in Chinese. I hope anyone can read it naturally without a translator so I rewrite the posts in multiple languages. It's for my own practice too. Feel free to compare the slight differences between languages if you know them.

You can subscribe to this blog even though this is just a website! This is made possible by using RSS, an "ancient" internet technology. Just copy the link of the "Wi-Fi logo" under my icon and paste it to your RSS reader. For phone you can use the open source Feeder and for browser you can use Feedbro.
