Now I can generate blog post directly from joplin thanks to [joppy](https://github.com/marph91/joppy), which is a python version of Joplin API. Finally I did something useful for myself using python. Old posts should not be just dead archives of past thoughts. I should review and improve them after some period.

If I could simply use Obsidian or VS Code to edit the files, why should I configure this mess? For the sake of open source? I'm tired...

I dived in to the source code of joppy, which is not complicated at all. It's just making requests to joplin's native API. Scrutinising other's work is really the best way to improve.

It's fine to make a copy for long posts, but it's clumsy to copy quick thoughts like tweet. Maybe I should improve this.

Syncthing proved too sluggish for syncing my Joplin notesâ€”Android's transfer throttling turned every load into a test of patience. The solution? A self-hosted Joplin server via Docker. Now, I can seamlessly edit my blog posts straight from my phone, without the wait.
