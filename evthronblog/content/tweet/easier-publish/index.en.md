Now I can generate blog post directly from joplin thanks to [joppy](https://github.com/marph91/joppy), which is a python version of Joplin API. Finally I did something useful for myself using python. Old posts should not be just dead archives of past thoughts. I should review and improve them after some period.

If I could simply use Obsidian or VS Code to edit the files, why should I configure this mess? For the sake of open source? I'm tired...

I dived in to the source code of joppy, which is not complicated at all. It's just making requests to joplin's native API. Scrutinising other's work is really the best way to improve.
