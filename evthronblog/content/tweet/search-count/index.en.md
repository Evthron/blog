After giving up on YouTube, Zhihu and games, mindless searching had become my only time drainer. I thought of a way to set a soft search limit by opening ten search tabs upon browser launch. Also, I removed the search function of the omnibar. That means I run out of searches after the ten tabs have been used. What an elegant solution.
