I finally migrated my operating system to linux. Surprisingly, I successfully found alternatives for everything. I also tried other interesting stuff like a tiling window manager (qtile is the only one that works out of the box). I could have been finished all the work faster but I wasted a lot of time browsing because there are no existing net blocking software on linux. Finding the key to lock the Pandora's box is really tough.
