I finally migrated my operating system to linux.

Originally, I wanted to do a small scale test on my old desktop computer, but my beloved ancient machine has failed me and refused to boot up. I have no choice but to install linux on my spare drive in my laptop. It's very simple although I need be very careful and not to accidentally wipe my original drive when formatting space.

Surprisingly, I successfully found linux alternatives for everything on Windows. I also tried other interesting stuff like a tiling window manager (qtile is the only one that works out of the box). I could have been finished all the work faster but I wasted a lot of time browsing because there are no existing net blocking software on linux. Finding the key to lock the Pandora's box is really tough.
