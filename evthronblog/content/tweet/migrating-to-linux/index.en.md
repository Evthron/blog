I finally migrated my operating system to linux.

Originally, I wanted to do a small-scale test on my old desktop computer, but my beloved ancient machine has failed me and refused to boot up. I have no choice but to install linux on my laptop's spare drive. It's very simple since I've tried that before on a virtual machine, but on bare metal I need be careful and not to accidentally wipe my original drive when formatting disk space.

Surprisingly, everything software I need on Windows has an linux alternative. I also tried other interesting stuff like a tiling window manager (qtile is the only one that works out of the box). I could have finished all the work earlier but I wasted a lot of time browsing because there are no ready-made net blocking software on linux. Finding the key to lock the Pandora's box is really tough.
