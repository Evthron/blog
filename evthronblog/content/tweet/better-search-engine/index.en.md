The search results from [marginalia.nu](https://search.marginalia.nu) are much more interesting than those from Google. I'm tired of those bloated SEO sites and adding "reddit" or "site:zhuanlan.zhihu.com" after every query! By the way if you like the old internet, there's another search engine called [Wiby](https://wiby.org) to help you find old and weird websites.

Anything that is fun and useless will eventually be blocked by my own hands. It's just a matter of time and frame of mind.
