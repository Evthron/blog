I hate holiday. It gives me a fake sense of comfort that I could slack off. Time flies no matter what I do. I always get stuck in deep regret and really annoyed by myself.

'This is such a tiny thing. I shouldn't be angry and waste any more time on this.' This meta emotion makes me feel angrier. What a vicious circle, until I can't take this anymore and cried. After that, I could sit down and write this reflection very easily. It's hard to admit, but emotion plays heavily of the tug-of-war between motivation and procrastination.
