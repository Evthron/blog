I used to think voice typing was a poor technology invented for people who couldn’t type correctly. It’s full of errors after all, especially in Chinese, where many words share the same sound and differ only in tones.

I changed my view after I tried [Speech Note](https://flathub.org/apps/net.mkiol.SpeechNote), which integrates common voice recognition models. The evolution of voice recognition surprised me with its accuracy. Thanks to my graphics card's CUDA, it transcrbes Chinese sentences in just a few seconds. Its performance is far better than Google’s voice recognition on my phone. 

The minor errors from the model can be easily corrected with AI, making voice typing a much more efficient input method now.  

Maybe I type too much and have forgotten how to speak. And voice typing is a great way to practice.
