The society follows the principles of economics:

- No one should do everything on their own, even if they could.
- To make a living, you just need to focus on one thing that only you can do.
	- Do one thing and do one thing well, like the Unix philosophy.
	- Ironically, that means as computer science student, I shouldn't be learning even a little bit of economics.

- Economic predictions don't work if we don't consider factors besides money, such as  happiness and health. Since economists can only think in terms of money, we can convert everything we care about into prices.
	- If you think about it, you realise that pretty much everything can be converted into prices.
	- However, if no exchange could be done, this so-called *price* is not very meaningful.

- If you want to make a lot of money, be a monopoly. Get a lisence, certificate, degree and anything that gives you the privilege to do the job so you can earn more than you should. Sure, it's great for you, but not so great for society.

- Otherwise, if you are in free competition, you need to work hard to be as efficient as your competitors. It's tough, but it's better for the consumers. That's capitalism.
