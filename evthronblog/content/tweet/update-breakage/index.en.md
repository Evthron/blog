I shouldn't update the system when I am doing work... what a classic mistake. The bookmark bar of Firefox became blank and the button layout is stirred up. I spent the whole night trying to open new profiles and imported all the setting twice but somehow it couldn't fix the problem. I have no choice but to remove all the profiles and reinstall firefox.

Joppy updates and spilt its API into clientAPI and serverAPI. I have to change my import statement in my python script to make it work. I now understand why people fixate on old versions.
