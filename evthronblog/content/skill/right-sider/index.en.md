Right-sider, the opposite of 'wrong-sider'. I altered the meaning a bit for my own use.

### How to talk to anyone
- A very practical conversation guide that helped me find the joy of small talk. Even if you were an alien from another universe, you can blend in with normal human by following those guildlines, starting from 'look into other's eyes'

### Getting relationships right
- It convinced me that I shoul seek for connection by presenting the framework of relationship. People are vastly different in their way of connceting. However, finding friends is not that hard since they only need to compatible in some aspects of connection. It explains what does it mean to be 'vulnerable'. It's actually meaning is really 'do not avoid emotional risk'.

### Never eat alone
- Attracted me by the book title and blew my mind by promoting 'get as many friends as you can'. Since the author is a businessman, you might think the book will tell you ways to manipulate others to benefit from relationships. Rather, you can still be very sincereto others while following his advice.
